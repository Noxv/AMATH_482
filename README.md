Course work for AMATH 482: Computational Methods in Data Analysis at the University of Washington.

Homework 1: Ultrasound Problem 
  -Used Fourier Transform and signal proccessing to identify an object within ultrasound data.

Homework 2: GÃ¡bor Transform
  -Used different transoforms to evaluate music to recreate the key of the music being played.

Homework 3: Video Tracking
  -Used PCA to track objecets in moving in space from three cameras.

Homework 4: Music Classification
  -Used PCA and LDA to classify three different artists from different genres and within the same genre. Also, built a clarrisfier that classified generes themselves.
  
Homework 5: Neural Networks
  -Built a fully connected and convolutional neural network and compared the results. Used the Fashion-MNST dataset and TensorFlow to build and train the networks.
